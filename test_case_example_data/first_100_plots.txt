 A short-lived quiz show hosted by TV veteran Jim Lange. Husband-and-wife
 teams would compete against each other in answering a tough series of
 trivia questions. The winning couple would then go on to the championship
 round, where they would have a chance to win one million dollars.
 Two married couples, sometimes including a returning champion, competed in
 one of the first game shows to offer $1 million as a grand prize. In
 "$1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime," which combined elements of "Wheel of
 Fortune" and "Scrabble," the couples competed to solve word puzzles. Up to
 six clues were given for the puzzle's solution; one member of each team was
 selected to try to guess each clue word, with letters inserted at random
 except for the last one. Each correct guess was worth $25 and allowed the
 contestant to go to the keyboard. The keyboard indicated which letters were
 in the puzzle, plus one "stinger" (an extra letter not in the puzzle);
 selecting the "stinger" meant the contestant lost his/her turn, and a new
 clue was played. Each selected letter revealed in the puzzle added $25 to
 the pot; the team that solves the puzzle won the pot. Three rounds were
 played, with the second round values of $50 per clue/puzzle letter and
 third round values of $100 each. The team with the most money after three
 rounds was champion, kept their winnings and advanced to the bonus round.
 In the bonus round, the couple selected a category from a choice of three
 and then are locked in an isolation booth. The couple has 60 seconds to
 guess six words associated with that category. For each successful bonus
 round win, the couple was given a cash prize ($5,000 on day 1, $10,000 on
 day 2), or they could give it back and continue, always at risk of losing a
 subsequent bonus round and thus having to leave the show. Only by winning
 three bonus rounds in a row did the couple win the $1 million grand prize.
 The $1 million was awarded as all cash during the spring 1986 season, and
 $900,000 plus a $100,000 luxury prize package (two Mazda cars, a house full
 of furniture, including a living room, dining room, bedroom, complete
 kitchen and outdoor spa, and twenty round-trip airline tickets to anywhere
 in America on Delta Air Lines) during the 1986-1987 season.
-------------32
 An updated version of the popular long-running quiz show, hosted by Jim
 Lange. Two contestants compete to see who has the greater knowledge of
 popular songs. As the music plays, the first contestant to name the song
 wins money and prizes. Additional challenges include the contestants
 'bidding' on how few notes they need in order to name that tune.
 Two contestants competed in a series of musical identification games in
 this 1980s five-day-a-week update of "Name That Tune." Games included
 Melody Roulette, where host Lange spun a carnival wheel to determine the
 dollar value of the tune; Tune Topics, where each song's title was related;
 and the famous Bid-a-Note, where contestants were given the clue to a song
 and then bid downward against each other to determine how few notes they
 needed ("I can name that tune in three notes!"). Contestants won points for
 winning each round; the high scorer after three rounds was champion and
 moved on to the "Golden Medley. In the "Golden Medley," the champion had to
 identify seven tunes within 30 seconds. Prizes were awarded for each
 correct answer. An incorrect guess stopped the game, while naming all seven
 tunes won an additional prize package and the right to return for a
 tournament (which took place every eight weeks or so) for $100,000 in cash
 and prizes. Some of the prizes offered for the tournament winners were
 awarded individually to winners in a home- viewer contest.

 is one million dollars. And they all become finalists and when the winner
 is announced, we see how he/she does after winning the money. And we all
 also see what happens to the other two after losing the jackpot.

 René Artois runs a small café in France during World War II. He always
 seems to have his hands full: He's having affairs with most of his
 waitresses, he's keeping his wife happy, he's trying to please the German
 soldiers who frequent his café, and he's running a major underground
 operation for the Resistance. Quite often, the Germans' incompetence itself
 is what nearly lands René and his cohorts in hot water; they are not helped
 either by the locals, who are dreadfully keen to get rid of the Germans,
 but their blatant and theatrical attempts at espionage and secrecy often
 create problems that René must solve quickly.
 René Artois is the owner and manager of a café in German-occupied France of
 World War II. To look at him, it's hard to believe that some women find him
 irresistible, something he has to work hard to hide from his wife Edith.
 René's café, frequented by both the German military and the French
 resistance, is the focal point for the show. René's a bit of a coward and
 is stuck in the middle, trying to humor both sides. Hidden in the café are
 two English airmen who don't understand a word of French. Other characters
 include Lt. Gruber, a homosexual German tank driver; Otto Flick, the evil
 SS officer who is always outsmarted; and Engelbert von Smallhausen, his
 small sidekick. René's not the only coward in town: Captain Hans Geering
 and Colonel Kurt von Strohm are constantly on the defensive, along with
 Captain Alberto Bertorelli of the Italian army who has a medal for
 servicing Fiats. Much of the farce comes from Officer Crabtree, an British
 agent disguised as a French policeman with a poor grasp of "Zee Fronch
 Linguige," and from René's amorous waitresses, Mimi, Yvette, and Maria.
 In this spoof of World War II, René Artois runs a café in German-occupied
 France. He is also an unwilling agent of the Germans, mostly under the
 command of Col. Kurt von Strohm, and of the French Resistance, under the
 command of Michelle Dubois ("Listen very carefully; I shall say this only
 once"). René is married to aged Edith, who is the worst singer in the
 world, but he finds that young women find him sexy. Most of the plots
 include planning the murder of the local commanding German officer, General
 Erich von Klinkerhoffen, as well as the ownership of a painting called "The
 Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies"--a painting that everybody would love
 to get their hands on to sell after the war. He has also two downed idiot
 British airmen who, as time goes by, are impossible to get rid of. The main
 opposition is the insane SS officer Otto Flick. René tries to complete the
 German and the Fench Resistance's plans, even though he's a coward and
 wonders if he's going to get out of the war alive.
-------------39
 Two years have elapsed and it is now September 1943. The airmen have
 escaped to England and Bertorelli and the Italian troops have withdrawn.
 Rene's hopes for peace and quiet are, however, dashed as Yvette announces
 her pregnancy. With the war now seeming to turn against Germany, Von
 Klinkerhoffen considers assassinating Hitler. Gruber and Von Strohm hope to
 sell the original painting, sell it and flee to Spain so they get Helga to
 steal it. To ensure her cut when the sale goes ahead she 'removes' one of
 the Fallen Madonna's boobies as her insurance.
-------------40
 Monsieur Alphonse has started working on the statue of René. Meanwhile, the
 final preparations for the parade to the coast (a cover in order to be able
 to get German plans in British hands) are made. General Von Klinkerhoffen
 wants to talk with the colonel and Gruber about the details concerning the
 plot to blow up Hilter. To make sure they aren't overheard, they'll discuss
 the plans during a game of golf. Eavesdropping Helga tells Herr Flick
 they're going golfing to discuss something important and Herr Flick decides
 to go, with Von Smallhausen and Helga, to the golf course to find out what
 they'll be discussing.
-------------41
 Colonel Von Strohm and Gruber agree to pay the ransom the Resistance
 ordered them to pay via a dogfish. They put the ten million francs in the
 dogfish and go to the river where the dogfish is to be exchanged for the
 incriminating photo. The dogfish however doesn't end up in the hands of the
 Resistance and the colonel and Gruber still don't have the photo.
 Meanwhile, general Von Klinkerhoffen has ordered Gruber and Colonel Von
 Strohm to dress up as Hitler and Göring pretending to leave town because he
 plans to catch any Resistance group that tries to attack them.
-------------42
 Rene is not looking forward to marrying Denise and agrees to a romantic
 dinner with Edith. Michelle has abducted Denise and hidden her in an old
 mine shaft, the plan being that Edith will take her place at the altar next
 day. Gruber, not happy at seeing the man he loves get married, is charged
 by the general to ask Rene where the paintings are and is assured that they
 are safe. The wedding goes ahead and Rene is surprised to see, when she
 lifts her veil, that his bride is Edith, not Denise. However the marriage
 is not legal because, in a counter-plan to prevent the union, the vicar has
 been replaced by Crabtree.
-------------43
 Now that General Von Klinkerhoffen is in the hospital, General Von
 Flockenstuffen is in command. He wants to redecorate Von Strohm's office
 and doesn't make himself very popular with Von Strohm, Helga and
 Bertorelli. Gruber however, likes him and gets to help in the redecoration.
 Meanwhile, madame Fanny and Ernest Leclerc have been arrested for stealing
 a motor bike and smashing through a German road block. Herr Flick thinks
 the old couple might have information about the British airmen and orders
 Von Smallhausen to commit a minor crime so he can be arrested and put in a
 cell with them in order to find out what they know.
-------------44
 Rene and the Cafe staff prepare to welcome the invading British troops, and
 soon find that the invasion party includes a couple of old friends.
 Lieutenant Gruber and the Colonel are ordered by the General to stay and
 fight the invaders, rather than surrender. However, seeing as their defeat
 is almost certain, the two German officers decide to go AWOL, disguised in
 stolen British uniforms. The second half of the episode is set many years
 after the war ends. Gruber, the Colonel and Helga, now private German
 citizens, return to their old French garrison in search of the old friends
 they made there.
-------------45
 Michelle sets out to blackmail Gruber, having discovered him with the photo
 of the painting, so he and Von Strohm hold up the German pay truck for the
 hush money. Flick finds out from Helga, to whom he has given a truth drug,
 but he and Von Smallhausen arrive too late to prevent the robbery and are
 arrested by Von Klinkerhoffen as the perpetrators. Rene, meanwhile, makes
 his first propaganda broadcast.
-------------46
 Michelle once again has a new and totally absurd plan to get the British
 airmen back home and René has had it: He secretly plans to take the train
 to Switzerland with Yvette and the paintings. Unfortunately Helga tells
 René to give colonel Von Strohm the paintings because Hitler himself wants
 the paintings and has send an art expert to verify their authenticity.
-------------47
 Edith and Rene manage to free Madame Fanny and LeClerc and hide them in a
 folding bed in the wall upstairs at the cafe. However they become literally
 embedded in the wall as the bed gets stuck and Alphonse decides to use
 dynamite to shift it. This is a total success but it also blows up the two
 Gestapo officers who have come to interrogate the old couple. Gruber
 however comes in to say they have been pardoned. Von Fluckenstuffen's plan
 to kidnap Hitler does not go down well with the other officers when they
 learn that they are to be part of his suicide squad. However Von
 Fluckenstuffen gets drunk and demands to inspect Rene's cellar,accusing him
 of keeping back his best wines. To guide his way he lights a candle,in
 reality a stick of dynamite which explodes,giving him a nervous breakdown.
 Thus he changes places with Von Klinkerhoffen in the 'fruitcake ward' and
 Rene is to be recommended for a medal.
-------------48
 Michelle wants Rene to set up a mobile radio station to broadcast
 propaganda, the parts of which will be dropped by plane. Unfortunately they
 fall down one of the chateau's chimneys. Happily a Spanish flamenco group
 are booked to perform there so Rene and his staff impersonate them. Gruber
 is aware that the real dance troupe contains a Spanish art expert to whom
 he is to give a photograph of the painting for copying, but he gives it to
 Alphonse by mistake.
-------------49
 Gruber is worried about the compromising photo of him with the painting of
 the Fallen Madonna with the big boobies the Resistance has and, with the
 colonel, decides to make a down payment on the ransom they demanded. Helga
 is still trying to rescue Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen using yet another
 disguise. Meanwhile, lead is needed for the battery of the mobile radio
 station and Yvette, Mimi, officer Crabtree and monsieur Alphonse go to the
 church in disguise to steal some lead from the roof. Gruber and the colonel
 have to play Hitler and Göring once more and end up being captured by the
 communist Resistance.
-------------50
 Flick and Von Smallhausen tunnel their way into the camp, only to find
 that, along with Gruber, everybody has escaped disguised as dancing girls.
 Flick intercepts Rene's call to London but Rene, realizing this, destroys
 his radio. The Resistance now have no radio. Nor do they have Maria, who
 disguised herself as a Red Cross parcel, but, due to insufficient stamps,
 was sent back to Switzerland. Geering has also gone, since the Resistance
 assumed he was an escaping British officer and took him to London, where he
 now has an office in Piccadilly Circus.
-------------51
 The resistance has found out that the Germans are planning to commandeer
 the pudding factory where the resistance had hidden the 1,000 kilo of
 explosives from the land mines. Because they don't want the Germans to have
 the explosives, the 1,000 kilo will be brought to Café René, disguised as
 500 Christmas puddings. Meanwhile, General Von Klinkerhoffen has ordered
 colonel Von Strohm and Gruber to find the stolen land mines and Herr Flick
 and Von Smallhausen (both in disguise) try to spy on the back room of Café
 René from the local church.
-------------52
 Herr Flick tells Helga the money that was stolen from the bank was his and
 he suspects General von Klinkerhoffen has stolen it. Michelle tells René
 and the others the stolen money will not be used to safe Mimi and the
 Germans but it will be split amongst them. When officer Crabtree tells them
 the money was from the Gestapo, it ends up in René's trousers. Meanwhile,
 René has found a way to improve Edith's performance.
-------------53
 General Von Klinkerhoffen is furious about the escape of the British airmen
 and announces he'll blow up the whole of Nouvion in 48 hours if the airmen
 are not in the hands of to the Germans by then. Herr Flick finds out about
 this and, because it'll take him months to make enemies in a new town,
 orders Von Smallhausen to dismantle the bombs. Michelle also hears about
 Von Klinkerhoffen's plan but still wants the airmen back to England. Her
 plan is to get them back by barrage balloon. Because a big barrage balloon
 might cause suspicion from the Germans, Madame Fanny and Ernest Leclerc
 need to wed so a marquee can cover the balloon.
-------------54
 Rene manages to photograph the safe,which is in Gruber's room and which
 LeClerc believes he can blow open. Alphonse tells Edith of Rene's affair
 with Yvette but she believes his denial. Von Klinkerhoffen takes a fancy to
 Helga and they have a private dinner in his room. Flick and Von
 Smallhausen,posing as gypsy violinists,serenade them in order to learn
 whether the general intends to kill Hitler. Smoke bombs are to be dropped
 down Gruber's chimney,causing a diversion which will allow Rene and LeClerc
 to come in and open the safe. By mistake the smoke bombs are thrown down
 the general's chimney instead and he calls the fire brigade.
-------------55
 Flick,dragged up as Irma Von Kinkenrotten,the disguise he used to plant the
 bug,is still in the dungeon. Von Strohm and Von Klinkerhoffen,aware that he
 knows of the forgeries,feel he should be silenced and hatch a plan. The
 Resistance,led by Rene dressed as Himmler,will spring him. The German
 officers,dressed as Gestapo,whom they will blame if anything goes wrong,are
 to thwart the escape and put paid to Flick. However,the Resistance have
 effected the escape before the Germans arrive and they find only Rene,who
 has swapped places with Flick as the prisoner.
-------------56
 While René is preparing to visit the empty grave of his fake dead twin
 brother, he is told by Michelle when to go because the Resistance is
 building a communication center in the grave to be able to contact London
 since the Germans jam the original radio station. Gruber, still not over
 the fact that it was he who shot René's twin brother, decides, after
 finding out René is going to the grave, to also go the grave, along with
 Helga. Meanwhile, Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen have a plan to find the
 headquarters of the Resistance: They will disguise themselves as shot-down
 British airmen and expect to be taken to the headquarters without any
 trouble. Madame Fanny has found a new love in Ernest Leclerc, brother of
 Roger Leclerc.
-------------57
 Colonel von Strohm wants the two paintings that are hidden in a statue at
 the château. He tells René and the staff of the café to pretend to be the
 Excelsior Quartet who are scheduled to play at the château and at the right
 moment steal the paintings out of the statue. The resistance also wants
 them to steal something, namely the Enigma machine the Germans recently
 acquired. Mimi, hidden in the double bass case, will take care of this.
 Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen are also going to the château disguised as
 serving maids because Herr Flick thinks some of the guests might be
 involved in the plot to blow up Hitler.
-------------58
 General Von Klinkerhoffen orders that René is to be shot if the Enigma
 machine isn't found. Because he thinks he might warn René, colonel Von
 Strohm orders Gruber to take of his uniform so he won't leave Von Strohm's
 office. Nevertheless, Gruber takes Helga's uniform and goes to René.
 Meanwhile, British Intelligence and the Resistance have thought up a plan
 to get two experts to Nouvion to look at the Enigma machine. They will be
 disguised as policemen.
-------------59
 René and monsieur Leclerq have been captured by the communist resistance.
 The leader of the group turns out to be Denise Laroque, an old sweetheart
 of René. Because of this, René and Leclerq won't be killed, but René has to
 marry Denise. Meanwhile the British airmen have had it with hiding at Cafe
 René and try to surrender to Germans so they can get into a proper prisoner
 of war camp.
-------------60
 Herr Flick tells Helga the stolen Gestapo money was false. When she tells
 this to the colonel he tells Bertorelli to get it back to René. What
 Bertorelli doesn't know is that Von Strohm anonymously called Herr Flick to
 say a man with feathers on his hat has the stolen money and is on his way
 to Cafe René. Michelle has a new plan to get the British airmen back to
 England; they'll be put in two emptied land mines and dropped over England.
 They then need to 'unscrew their nuts' and land safely using their
 parachutes. The parachutes will be brought by monsieur Leclerq, who'll be
 disguised as a pillow-stuffer. Meanwhile, the communist girls leave Cafe
 René.
-------------61
 Colonel Von Strohm and Gruber have failed to escape to Spain and come back
 to café René. Edith thinks up a plan for them to make general Von
 Klinkerhoffen believe they had been kipnapped by the Resistance: They are
 to hide in the old windmill in order to fake their kidnapping.
 Unfortunately, general Von Klinkerhoffen has planned target practices using
 the windmill as target. Meanwhile, Herr Flick has had plastic surgery so he
 can flee to Argentina when the war is over.
-------------62
 Gruber and the colonel are still disguised as Hitler and Göring and are
 still being hold by the Communist Resistance. Michelle finds out about this
 and (because she, like the communists, doesn't know it are not really
 Hitler and Göring) decides to kidnap them so the French Resistance will get
 the honor of ending the war. Meanwhile, Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen are
 about to face the firing squad for robbing the German pay truck.
-------------63
 René is going to be given the collaboration medal by the Germans. If he
 accepts it, the resistance will have him shot. If he doesn't, the Germans
 will have him shot. Therefore he plans to go to England with Yvette,
 instead of the two British airmen, Fairfax and Carstairs.
-------------64
 Rene has successfully got the painting back so Michelle concentrates on her
 plan to get the airmen away in the ancient aeroplane. It is to be drawn by
 a car and catapulted into the air,requiring Rene to steal 800 metres of
 men's braces,which he does under the guise of his Brotherhood of the
 Night-Owl. Flick and Helga,aware that something may be afoot,turn up in his
 staff car but it is flattened by a runaway steam-roller so they miss seeing
 the failed escape when the plane fails to take off and Rene is flung
 through the air.
-------------65
 When feeding the long distance duck, René sees she has given birth to a
 group of ducklings. Nevertheless, Michelle orders René to launch the duck.
 Gruber, colonel Von Strohm, Helga and captain Bertorelli are dividing the
 money that was stolen from the bank and Herr Flick - who owned the stolen
 money - is ordered by his uncle Heinrich Himmler to find the money again,
 even though it was forged money. Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen start
 selling fish in the town square hoping somebody will pay with the forged
 money so they can arrest and interrogate this person. Meanwhile, hearty
 eaters Denise Laroque and Louise are still hiding at Cafe René.
-------------66
 To replace Maria,Michelle brings in Mimi Labonq,who is very tiny but very
 tenacious and vows to be Rene's bodyguard. She is also very fanatical and
 Rene has to stop her from poisoning Flick. A new radio is also brought to
 the cafe by Roger LeClerc but this coincides with the arrival of Geering's
 replacement,the Italian Captain Bertorelli. He too almost falls victim to
 Mimi when he misunderstands her invitation to go upstairs and look at some
 paintings.
-------------67
 Gruber is about to mince the sausage his dog brought in when he discovers
 the painting. The Resistance pay off Alphonse,who provided the ransom
 money,with notes forged by LeClerc whilst Gruber is ordered to fake another
 copy of the picture. Michelle intends to get the airman out using an old
 aeroplane in the museum. It will be powered by the motor from Von
 Klinkerhoffen's lawn mower,which she has smuggled out in Madame Fanny's
 wheelchair.
-------------68
 Michelle saves René's skin and his reputation by telling Alphonse that he
 is an heroic member of the Resistance. Alphonse thus has too much respect
 for him to kill him. However Rene is in drag, which gets him more attention
 from Gruber. Flick has imprisoned Von Strahm and Geering and also captures
 Rene, planning to torture them to reveal what happened to the painting.
 Fortunately Von Klinkerhoffen stops him as he has more influential
 connections than Flick in the German high command. The airmen are taken to
 the balloon dressed as mourners in a fake funeral for Madame Fanny who has
 allegedly died of the plague.
-------------69
 Because she is pregnant with his child, Yvette talks René into trying to
 arrange a marriage. Michelle hears Hitler and Göring will come to Nouvion
 and plans to blow them up. What Michelle doesn't know, is that they aren't
 the real Hitler and Göring. Herr Flick, still in jail with Von Smallhausen,
 waiting to get executed, tells Helga he knows Von Strohm and Gruber robbed
 the pay truck and that he will tell the general this unless they rescue
 him. A plan is thought up: Helga, disguised as a nun, will bring Herr Flick
 a stick of dynamite, disguised as a knackwurst. And to think all of this is
 happening at René's birthday!
-------------70
 Herr Flick has arrested monsieur Leclerc because he thinks he has the
 stolen money. When it turns out he hasn't got the money, Herr Flick
 announces Leclerc will be shot if the money won't be returned.
 Unfortunately, Madame Fanny has burned the money - that was kept in the
 oven - when trying to cook a potato, which actually was the spy camera that
 was to be used to photograph the invasion of England plans. Meanwhile, Von
 Strohm has found out about the two missing land mines and tells Gruber to
 talk to René, in case he might know anything about them.
-------------71
 Rene considers flight to Spain dressed as an onion-seller but is stopped by
 the German officers who ask about the painting. It ends up back with Von
 Klinkerhoffen, to the annoyance of Flick, who asks Helga help him retrieve
 it. However she flirts with Bertorelli to make him jealous. Michelle puts
 the airmen in wine barrels in Rene's cellar to smuggle them out but the
 general turns up and orders that the barrels be sent to the chateau.
-------------72
 General Von Klinkerhoffen asks Von Strohm and Gruber who knew about the
 meeting of the generals where someone tried to poison them. When Von Strohm
 tells him René knew about it, Von Klinkerhoffen tells them to catch and
 execute René. Herr Flick however, thinks the big-nosed French collaborating
 general had something to do with the plot to poison the generals and tries
 to find him. Meanwhile, René wants to quit the resistance and gets several
 disguises he can use to avoid being caught.
-------------73
 While he was in the bell tower of the church, Herr Flick saw the two stolen
 land mines in the Butcher's Yard next to Café René. When he and Von
 Smallhausen find out they are empty, they both hide inside them in order to
 catch resistance members when they come to transport the mines. Meanwhile,
 Helga told the colonel and Gruber the whereabouts of the land mines and the
 colonel - not knowing the mines are empty and harmless and Flick and Von
 Smallhausen are in them - orders Bertorelli and his men to move the land
 mines to the German air base. After finding out about this, Michelle comes
 up with a plan to get the British airmen into the mines and back to
 England.
-------------74
 René is kept by the communist Resistance as a love slave in their
 underground hide-out in the forest. Meanwhile, everybody thinks René has
 died in the windmill explosion. Everybody is very saddened and officer
 Crabtree comes up with the idea to erect a statue in memory of René. The
 colonel and Gruber, when visiting the café to find out where the painting
 is and express their sympathy, agree to pay for the statue. Meanwhile, Herr
 Flick takes of the bandages and reveals his new face while René tries to
 escape from the Resistance.
-------------75
 Because of the precautions taken by Edith and Yvette & Mimi, René hasn't
 married Denise Laroque. Now René is afraid Denise wants to kill him and
 tries - while being disguised as his own father - to find a place to hide.
 The colonel and the captain tell him they can't help him but the colonel
 decides a disguised Helga should protect him because René is the only one
 who knows where the paintings are. Meanwhile, the British airmen are still
 trying to find a way out of their never changing status quo of being stuck
 at Cafe René's.
-------------76
 Because Berlin blames him for the cock-up concerning the meeting of the
 German generals, general Von Klinkerhoffen decides to send colonel Von
 Strohm and Gruber to the Russian front. Von Strohm and Gruber want to flee
 to the Vatican and hide out there until the war is over. For this, they
 need to sell the paintings that are hidden in the headquarters of the
 Communist Resistance. They tell René to get the paintings. When Michelle of
 the resistance hears of this, she tells René to get the paintings, give
 copies to the colonel and Gruber and sell the originals for the resistance
 funds.
-------------77
 The airmen,wearing German uniforms,are captured by the Maquis,but escape
 and burn the uniforms,taking clothes off scarecrows instead before
 disguising themselves as onion sellers. Von Strohm and Geering,now without
 uniforms,are angry with Rene and he is given two carrier pigeons to send to
 London for replacement uniforms. He uses the radio transmitter hidden under
 Madame Fanny's bed instead when Edith kills and cooks the pigeons.
 Rene's problems continue to mount. Colonel von Strohm and Captain Geering
 are sitting in the café posing as onion sellers. The British airmen have
 escaped posing as Germans but Michelle informs the café owner that they
 have been taken prisoner by the Communist resistance. The only solution
 they can come up with is to have new uniforms made in London. Without
 access to the radio, they decide to use carrier pigeons. Meanwhile, Leclerc
 the forger realizes that he and Edith's mother were once lovers.
-------------78
 The airmen are disguised as waitresses at the cafe.However,Von
 Klinkerhoffen recognizes a Van Gogh,behind which Rene has hidden The Fallen
 Madonna,and he requisitions it to be taken to the chateau,along with the
 two 'waitresses'. To thwart this an elaborate pantomime is staged,whereby
 the two men dress as tarts out to seduce Rene.A supposedly enraged Edith
 then 'shoots' them with a gun loaded with blanks. The 'corpses' are taken
 to Alphonse's funeral parlour under which a tunnel has been dug,connecting
 to the prisoner-of-war camp across the road,in which it is planned to hide
 the two fugitives.
-------------79
 The newspaper is published with Edith on the cover representing the 'Spirit
 of Nouvion'. For the second edition the general decides there should be a
 show marriage,to be annulled after the war,in order to cement local
 relations. Edith will marry one of the occupying officers - Bertorelli.
 There will be a celebration and this will include wine - from the barrels
 containing the airmen. Michelle and her group manage to float the barrels
 out through the sewers but they get stuck behind a grid under the cafe.
-------------80
 Whilst the suspicious Flick and his henchman Von Smallhausen dig their own
 tunnel into the camp,the prisoners are planning a mass escape. Von Strohm
 volunteers Geering as the first to go and he is catapulted over the wire
 and spirited away into the woods by the Resistance. Gruber dresses as a nun
 in order to get into the camp to free the others but they take advantage of
 an entertainment about to be staged and dress up as dancing girls.
-------------81
 The Resistance capture Von Stahm and Geering, whom they intend to shoot in
 return for the death of the late cafe owner. The task of shooting them is
 to be given to Rene in revenge for his brother's slaying. Fortunately he is
 able to enable all three of them to escape in time to meet the plane
 bringing the forged painting back from England,which they intend to return
 to Flick. Unfortunately it is only after the hand-over has been
 accomplished that they discover that they gave him the genuine original and
 they have the copy.
 It's Col. von Strohm's birthday and Rene bakes him a cake and has a little
 party for him in the café. They are still awaiting the return of the
 painting of the fallen Madonna with the big boobies which is being copied
 in London. The Colonel and Capt. Geering are taken prisoner by the
 communist Resistance who plan on executing them for having had Rene shot by
 a firing squad. They want Rene to do the honors but he is saved from having
 to shoot them by the women from the café dressed as Germans. They finally
 receive the original and copy of the famous painting but Geering gives the
 wrong one to Herr flick of the Gestapo.
-------------82
 Monsieur Alphonse has asked Edith to marry him. When René hears about this
 and figures he'll lose the café and everything in it (notably the gold in
 the cuckoo's clock), he decides to ask Edith to marry him and she says yes.
 Bertorelli will cook a great feast and monsieur Alphonse, being the deputy
 mayor, will marry them. Meanwhile, general Von Klinkerhoffen suspects
 colonel Von Strohm of stealing his gold while Herr Flick thinks it was René
 who took the gold. Herr Flick tells Helga to use her feminine charm to
 elicit the whereabouts of the gold from René.
-------------83
 René is back home and Michelle tells him that, with the Germans thinking
 he's dead, she has planned for him to go to England to help the British win
 the war. When this plan is postponed, René hides out in the museum where
 his shoes and beret (which is all that is believed to be left of him after
 the windmill explosion) will soon be exhibited. Meanwhile, Herr Flick, just
 like colonel Von Strohm, still wants to know where the painting is and
 invites madame Edith over for tea. Madame Fanny and monsieur Leclerc return
 from Paris.
-------------84
 On the discovery that a gypsy fair takes place annually in the village, the
 new Resistance plan is to place a gypsy tent over the grid to disguise the
 escape. However, the real gypsies cry off, following a bad omen, and Rene
 and his staff take their places. Rene is a fortune teller, to whom Gruber
 comes, seeking a message from Rene's 'brother' on the other side. He is
 frightened off by the sounds of the airmen and runs off as they emerge from
 the grid - followed by three other airmen, who return to the sewer at the
 sight of Edith. Flick has Elsa put the forgery in von Strohm's office but
 they are found out by the general.
-------------85
 Von Klinkerhoffen assumes that the 'gypsies' caused the smoke bomb incident
 and orders their arrest,so they hide in the wardrobe. This gets blown to
 bits when LeClerc blows the safe up,but its contents are not the invasion
 plans but the original Fallen Madonna painting and the Van Gogh the general
 stole from Rene.The Gestapo officers, Rene and LeClerc all escape but the
 last two are disguised as Germans and are captured by the Communist
 Resistance and held prisoner in an old saw-mill. Flick believes the safe
 blew up because Gruber was hiding explosives with which to kill Hitler and
 orders Helga to chat him up to find out more. Whilst she is doing so
 Crabtree and the resistance steal Gruber's tank in order to rescue Rene and
 LeClerc but Edith crashes it into the village's public convenience.
-------------86
 Because they think he's gone round the twist, the Germans call General Von
 Flockenstoffen to deal with Von Klinkerhoffen who still wants to blow up
 the whole of Nouvion. Herr Flick and Von Smallhausen try to disarm the bomb
 in the sewer while an old flame of René has her own plan to stop the
 Germans from blowing up the town. Meanwhile, Ernest Leclerc and madame
 Fanny have just been wed and in the marquee the celebrations have started
 while the Resistance girls are secretly working on the barrage balloon that
 should get the British airmen back to England.
-------------87
 Michelle brings a bottle of nitro-glycerine to the cafe for safe keeping
 until it is time for her to use it to blow up a German train. However as it
 is in a gin bottle Edith thinks it really is gin and gives some to Madame
 Fanny. Rene and the two German officers meet the plane bringing their
 uniforms but on board there is only a Jewish tailor who takes their
 measurements. He does,however,take the painting of The Fallen Madonna with
 the Big Boobies back to London to be copied.
 Michelle from the Resistance entrusts Rene with a Bols gin bottle filled
 with nitro glycerin. He has trouble in the bar however when Lt. Gruber want
 a drink. Rene refuses but as soon as he turns his back Edith, who knows
 about the nitro, gives some to her mother and even to the chickens in the
 hopes they will lay more eggs. London is sending an airplane with the new
 German uniforms and to collect the painting of the fallen Maddona with the
 big boobies so that a copy can be made. The uniforms arrive in the company
 of a Saville Row tailor for the fitting.
-------------88
 Rene is annoyed when the airmen return and sends them away dressed as nuns
 with instructions to hide in the local convent. Edith,officially a
 widow,finds Rene's will,naming her as sole beneficiary,and sets out to
 spend his money on a new hat to attract other suitors. Flick gets
 Gruber,who once worked in an art gallery,to identify the original painting
 whilst the 'nuns' return and end up hiding in the piano.
-------------89
 The hinges on the grid are rusted on solid so Alphonse will chisel away at
 the surrounds and the grating will be winched up. To camouflage the action
 Rene will park his old ice cream van over the grating. However Von
 Klinkerhoffen decides that he wants an ice cream and,at that very
 moment,the winch pulling the grating up blows the pump on the ice cream
 maker,covering the general with vanilla ice cream. Meanwhile Helga has gone
 on a training course and her replacement,Elsa,takes an instant shine to
 Flick.
-------------90
 René and Edith get rescued from being shot by general Von Karzibrot by
 British troops. However, the British think they are Hitler and Göring and
 arrest them. Meanwhile, everybody thinks René and Edith are death. Michelle
 takes over the café while madame Fanny and Leclerc run off to Paris in
 René's old ice cream car. Colonel Von Strohm and Gruber want to flee to
 Spain because the Resistance will sent the photo of Gruber with the
 painting to general Von Klinkerhoffen. Before they go, they plan to swap
 the painting for the ten million francs Herr Flick found in a dogfish Von
 Smallhausen made for dinner.
-------------91
 Flick comes across Michelle by the roadside,lying in wait for an ammunition
 lorry which she plans to blow up with a detonator disguised as a bicycle
 pump - however Flick mistakes it for a genuine cycle pump and blows his car
 up. Another escape attempt is to be made for the airmen,this time in a
 balloon and silk knickers are vanishing from the village washing lines to
 provide the material. Rene explains that the knickers are actually
 providing the material for Edith's wedding dress,as she has agreed to
 re-marry him. Monsieur Alphonse,who is already wooing Edith, is enraged at
 being spurned and challenges Rene to a duel.
-------------92
 Flick and Von Smallhausen are interrogated by the general for impersonating
 army officers but released on the orders of Himmler - thanks to Helga. A
 party of intelligence officers are visiting and the Resistance plan to
 hi-jack their car,steal their uniforms and that way infiltrate the chateau
 to get the airmen out. Rene and Edith are the reluctant 'intelligence
 officers' but the plan works fairly well until the couple find themselves
 handcuffed to the airmen whilst the key to unlock them is in Berlin.
-------------93
 The Communist Resistance has captured Von Strohm, Gruber, Bertorelli and
 his men. René (still disguised as a Franciscian vicar) has given them the
 copies of the paintings - which they think are the real ones - and
 convinces the communists not to shoot them, but ask ransom for them. The
 communists let René and Leclerq go and decide to keep Mini (who's still
 disguised as a baby, with the original paintings in her nappies). It turns
 out general Von Klinkerhoffen won't pay the ransom and Michelle suggests
 robbing the town bank in order to pay the ransom and get Von Strohm,
 Gruber, Bertorelli, Mimi and, most important, the paintings back safe and
 sound.
-------------94
 A plan to flee to Geneva René and Yvette made will have to wait because
 general Von Klinkerhoffen - in order to find the stolen Enigma machine -
 has decided no one is to leave the town or they'll be shot. Michelle, who
 is disguised as a pregnant woman in order to fool the Germans, delivers
 René the Enigma machine and tells him to put it in a wine barrel and throw
 it in the sewer. The whole population of Nouvion will flush the toilet at
 the same time which will enable the barrel to reach the canal where a
 British submarine is waiting for the Enigma machine.
-------------95
 World War II is raging, but in the French village of Nouvion, café owner
 Rene Artois wants only a quiet life, plus some slap and tickle with his
 waitress Yvette behind his sour wife Edith's back. To this end, he keeps in
 with two German officers who are regular café patrons, Kurt Von Strohm and
 Hans Geering. He is therefore alarmed when Michelle of the Resistance
 declares his house a safe house for two British airmen who have been shot
 down and who don't speak a word of French. He is also to host Roger
 Leclerc, a forger and old flame of his mother-in-law Fanny, who was sprung
 from jail by the Resistance but, due to a misunderstanding, mistakes Hubert
 Gruber, a German officer who turns out to be gay and fancies René, for the
 forger. Geering and Von Strohm discover the hidden British airmen, but when
 Herr Otto Flick of the Gestapo arrives, they agree to help. This is because
 Flick is after a favourite painting of Hitler's, "The Fallen Madonna with
 the Big Boobies," which they wish to keep for themselves. To this end, they
 give their uniforms to the escaping airmen.
 René Artois runs a café in the small German-occupied town of Nouvion in
 central France. He has a relationship with a local German commander,
 Colonel Kurt von Strohm, whereby Rene gets essential supplies such as
 butter and sugar, and the Germans get to spend time with one of Rene's
 pretty waitresses. René isn't sure what to do when Michelle from the French
 Resistance tells him that his café will now be a stop on the escape route
 for British airmen. Additionally, he is expected to provide shelter for
 their forger, Roger Leclerc. As if he doesn't have enough to deal with, von
 Strohm steals a valuable painting from the château that the Germans have
 commandeered for the local headquarters, "The fallen Madonna with the Big
 Boobies" by van Klomp. Amid the chaos that has become René's life, they
 learn that Otto Flick of the Gestapo has arrived.
-------------96
 General Von Klinkerhoffen wants to continue the meeting of the Generals,
 but because he thinks the Communist Resistance might want to blow them up,
 he has planned for a group of peasants to be dressed up like generals and
 come together at the town square while the generals - disguised as onion
 sellers - will meet at the café. A new group of shot down British airmen
 will also come to the café, also disguised as onion sellers. Meanwhile,
 Herr Flick is recovering in traction and Leclerc and Madame Fanny are going
 out for a walk.
-------------97
 Rene is finally rescued by Gruber and returns to the cafe,where Michelle
 tells him that he must take the camera,hidden in a potato,into the chateau
 and photograph the invasion plans in the safe. The general is lured away to
 the cafe,where,surviving a seduction attempt by Edith,he finds the colonel
 in bed with Yvette. Rene is about to enter the chateau when there is an air
 raid.
-------------98
 Herr Flick is worried about his career in the Gestapo after all the recent
 cock-ups and feels he has to flee. For this he needs money and he demands
 René to give him the painting so he can sell it. Von Strohm, Gruber, Helga
 and Bertorelli also want the painting back and sell it because the escape
 of the airmen has made them nervous about their futures too. Meanwhile,
 Crabtree is reunited with an old love!
-------------99

Hearing that Flick intends to send the painting back to Berlin next day Von
 Stahm directs Rene to make the switch that night. A diversion is arranged
 in the form of a Hitler Youth Dance,in which local girls dressed in
 Bavarian costumes will perform for the Gestapo officer's delight. Meanwhile
 Rene and Edith,wearing the German uniforms that arrived on the plane,will
 take the forgery back to Flick's office. Unfortunately the guard takes the
 painting from them and sends them away. Now Flick has the original,the
 London forgery and one he made himself to work a fiddle that would get him
 money to marry Helga after the war.Meanwhile the airmen are smuggled to the
 coast but,on hearing that there is no submarine for them and they must row
 home,return to the village.
 Having given Herr Flick the real painting of the Fallen Madonna with the
 Big Boobies by Von Klomp instead of the forgery, Col. von Strohm and Capt.
 Geering have to find a way to switch them. They throw a party at the café
 where the girls entertain in Hitler Youth uniforms, something that will
 definitely draw Flick's attention. With he party going on, Rene and Edith
 will disguise themselves as German officers and make the switch. Nothing
 quite works out as planned however.
-------------100
